Title:
FLARE(Fault Logging and Assessment for Responsive EV repairs)

Abstract:
The FLARE project aims to automate fault detection in EV charging stations using Semantic Segmentation and Vision-Transformer-based Image Classification. By leveraging real-world data, we help identify charger malfunctions faster and improve maintenance response times.
