# artifact-directory-template

This repository is a template for turning in links/locations to your
project artifacts. Instructions:

1. Fork this repository.
   * You will be changing the file contents in this repository, but
     *do not change the file names!*
2. Replace the blank `report.pdf` with your final project report. This is the version that will be linked at [hdsishowcase.com](https://hdsishowcase.com). (Note that you will also have to upload your report separately to Gradescope for your mentor to grade it.)
3. Edit `title-abstract.txt` and replace the sample title/abstract
   with the title/abstract of your project. This is what will be included at [hdsishowcase.com](https://hdsishowcase.com).
   * Be sure to leave the formatting of the file intact (with the
     `title:` and `abstract:` lines untouched).
   * If you are happy with the title that's currently at [hdsishowcase.com](https://hdsishowcase.com), feel free to put the same one.
4. Edit the `artifacts.json` file with links to your project
   artifacts. Do NOT change the keys of the json file, only the
   values.
   * `this-repository` contains the GitHub URL to your forked
     `artifact-directory-template` repository (this will allow us to
     get the latest version of your report and title/abstract).
   * `project-repository` contains the GitHub URL to your project's code repository. This is the repository we will use to evaluate your code.
   * `project-website-url` contains the URL to your public-facing project website (likely ending in .github.io/<some project name>).
   * `project-website-code` contains the GitHub URL to your project
     website's source code (if it's the same as your code repository,
     then re-list that URL here).
5. Turn in the forked repository to Gradescope **as a group** (that is, make only one submission).
   * The autograder on Gradescope just ensures that you submitted everything in the correct format.
